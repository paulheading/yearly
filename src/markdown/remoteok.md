I've been a Front-End Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the Digital Products team at the Barbican. I spend my time writing JavaScript and building things with Vue.js.


I love building things and solving problems. I've always been creative, but it was graphic design that taught me how to use it in a productive way.

Design and development are about communicating ideas, removing obstacles and bringing joy where possible.


My career began in print design. I worked at skyecreative.co.uk and brandwavemarketing.com before joining the Barbican in 2013.


I began working as a digital designer, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML adverts with JavaScript.


During this time I also began mentoring a young designer (ernestwereko.com) and built the website/brand for 36bournestreet.com.



This was the start of my journey into web development, as I began studying for a Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree at teamtreehouse.com.


In 2020 the Barbican created a brand new job role (Front-end Designer & Developer) which I moved into to. 


I currently work with Vue.js on a range of projects (Event Management App, Building Account Areas) for the Barbican, as well as recently completing sparkthecannon.com (built with Next.js) for a freelance client.



My portfolio site is built using the Astro framework in combination with a few external APIs. I use Trello to organise my case studies and pull playlists from Spotify.
