Hey üëã I'm Paul, a Front-end Designer & Developer.


I've been a Front-End Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the **Digital Products** team at the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk). I spend my time writing JavaScript and building things with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).


Before 2020, I worked as a¬†[Designer](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/paul-heading)¬†üë®‚Äçüé® in the [Barbican Design Studio](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/barbican).

### What have I made


I currently work with Vue.js on a range of projects ([Event Management App](https://paul.ly/projects/organising-spaces-with-graphql/), [Building Account Areas](https://paul.ly/projects/designing-account-areas-in-vuejs/)) for the Barbican, as well as recently completing [sparkthecannon.com](https://paul.ly/projects/sparking-the-cannon-with-nextjs/) (built with Next.js) for a freelance client.



My portfolio site is built using ~~[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)~~ the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework in combination with a few external APIs. I use [Trello](https://trello.com) to organise my case studies and pull playlists from [Spotify](https://spotify.com).


I also upload videos alongside projects for extra context. If you'd like to see more information on a particular project, please do let me know.

### My journey so far

I love building things and solving problems. I've always been creative, but it was graphic design that taught me how to use it in a productive way.

Design and development are about communicating ideas, removing obstacles and bringing joy where possible.


My career began in print design. I worked at [Skye Creative](http://www.skyecreative.co.uk/) and [Brandwave](https://brandwavemarketing.com/) before joining the Barbican in 2013.


I began working as a digital designer, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML adverts with JavaScript.


During this time I also began mentoring a young designer ([Ernest Wereko](https://www.ernestwereko.com/)) and built the website/brand for [36 Bourne Street](https://paul.ly/projects/selling-designer-fabric-with-wordpress/). 



This was the start of my journey into web development, as I began studying for a [Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/plans) at [TeamTreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com).


In 2020 the Barbican created a brand new job role (Front-end Designer & Developer) which I moved into to.
