# BA History

I began creating design work for friends projects while studying History at <a href="https://gold.ac.uk">Goldsmiths University</a>. I created banners for the ski society, visuals for a burlesque show and a catalogue for the BA Textiles degree show. After a disastrous experience studying Fine Art at A-Level, I was discouraged from pursuing a career in the creative industries. It was not until midway through university that I returned to doing something that I love.

### What did I learn?

I learnt that I loved to create, build and design. I also learnt that I work best when responding to a brief or solving a specific problem.
