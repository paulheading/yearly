# Sparking the Cannon with Next.js

Build and animate the website for Stephanie Cannon, a professional Voice-over Artist.

<br>

### Can I see it?

Sure, it's at [sparkthecannon.com](https://sparkthecannon.com)

The code is in my public [Github](https://github.com) [repository](https://github.com/paulheading/steph23).

I've started writing about [this project](https://blog.paul.ly/preview/64908a776fdc99000f5daf42) on [my blog](https://blog.paul.ly).

<br>

### How much did you do?

Everything! Except the wonderful illustration. This includes:

- 💻 Building the site in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- 🎨 Designing the layouts with [Figma](https://figma.com)
- 🚀 Animating the brand artwork in [GSAP](https://greensock.com)
- 📝 Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

<br>

### What are the interesting parts?

Definitely the various bespoke playlists and audio players. Note to self: write a case study on those. The animations are also pretty cute and the brand colour palette is delicious.

<br>

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.
- **Accessibility** 😥 It's pretty limited. Areas like [color contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker) and [focus states](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states) need further consideration.
