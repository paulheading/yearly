# Leytonstone Loves Film

Build and animate the website for a community festival called Leytonstone Loves Film.

<br>

### Can I see it?

Sure, it's at [leytonstonelovesfilm.com](https://leytonstonelovesfilm.com)

The code is in a private [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repository sadly.

<br>

### How much did you do?

Everything on the frontend, which includes:

- 💻 Building the site in [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com)
- 🚀 Animating the brand artwork in [GSAP](https://greensock.com)
- 📝 Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

<br>

### What are the interesting parts?

I'd say the build itself was pretty interesting for this one. We had a large group of stakeholders who needed to update the site content, so we used a Drupal CMS for the backend and Nuxt.js for consuming CMS data on the frontend. It was definitely a journey learning how to build with that data and understanding the different forms it may arrive in.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.
- **Accessibility** 😥 It has none. Areas like [color contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker) and [focus states](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states) were not considered at build time.
