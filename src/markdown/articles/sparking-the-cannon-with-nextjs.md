### The Project

A brand refresh and new website for voiceover artist Stephanie Cannon. The new website must be fast, mobile-friendly and cohesively communicate her new brand.

**Why?** Steph needed a website that showcased her portfolio of work and enabled potential clients to understand which areas she specialises in. It should also reflect her new branding.

**How?** First, we’ll work on wireframes and visual identity in [Figma](https://figma.com). Then we’ll start creating a static website in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

_Steph's previous website was too simple. The content needed more structure and the identity needed more personality._

Initially, I worked with Steph to create a content structure that was intuitive to users, particularly those looking to work with her. This process allowed me to visualise how an initial design could look. I could now imagine what kind of navigation we would need and how creative we could be with the layout.

I also encouraged Steph to commission an illustration for her brand. This would form the focus for all her branded material and also provide us with an initial colour scheme.

Finally, Steph didn't like iframes...

### The Response

_Initial visuals introduced more content structure and made use of the new branded illustrations._

I found that introducing a new colour palette and restructuring the entire layout was quite an ambitious task, so I broke the work into two stages. First, I focussed on the layout. I wanted to create a modular layout that would collapse into mobile gracefully and could accommodate multiple audio players without looking cluttered.
