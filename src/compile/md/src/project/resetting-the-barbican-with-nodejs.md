# Resetting the Barbican with Node.js

Build the [Barbican Reset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barbican-reset). An [NPM package](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) that can be used across the [Barbican's](https://barbican.org.uk) many digital products to provide consistent styling and functionality.

### Can I see it?

Sure, it's at [npmjs.com/package/barbican-reset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barbican-reset)

The code is in a private [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repository sadly. But feel free to download the [Barbican Reset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barbican-reset) and review the production code.

### How much did you do?

Pretty much everything, which includes:

- 💻 Building the package for [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- 💡 Creating components for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- 📝 Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

<br>

### What are the interesting parts?

This was the first time I created an NPM package, so that was new and interesting for me. Understanding how to provide functionality for both vue and drupal was also a challenge, providing both styled components and a set of useful mixins that would make replicating those components easy.

<br>

### What needs improving?

- **Compatibility** 😥 We're currently in the process of moving the project to vue 3 and removing dependency on Bootstrap.
- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.
