It's taken me a long time ‚è±Ô∏è to build this website. 

The internet is fast, but good ideas are slow and good solutions are even slower üê¢. 

I've been working on this same brief now for around fifteen years. In some ways things have got easier:

- I am better able to describe what I do best
- I have skills and experience now
- It takes me less time to build complex things

But in some ways things have got harder:

- There are more ways than ever to build a portfolio
- This means more time spent experimenting and potentially wasting time
- Roles have become more specialised

In part one of "Building my portfolio" I want to write about how I got to this point.

<br>

I've had two really good ideas üíÖ for presenting a portfolio in my life so far. 

The first came way back in 2013, when I printed and hand-folded a replica AA roadmap üó∫Ô∏è. It was successful for many reasons:

- When folded it was small enough to post to employers
- When unfolded it was large enough to display my design work
- The original product was literally created to display routes and progress
- It showcased both my creativity and competence as a print designer

This was a "good idea" in that the uniqueness of the portfolio not only fulfilled the brief, but elavated the whole concept, helping to communicate the message more effectively.

I then moved into digital design and spent a long time trying to find my next portfolio "good idea". 

One issue I found was that there were too many possibilities and too many frameworks. 

Also, the medium is not very interesting. Websites have lost their novelty, their popularity and ubiquity have made them ordinary.

So to make an interesting website, I decided I would either need to mimic a time when websites were exciting, or present something that didnt actually feel like a website.

And so came my second "good idea" for a portfolio. It only arrived roughly 18 months ago. Whereas idea number 1 delivered a visual pun wrapped in a tangible product, idea number 2 would be a personal platform for ideas, a conversation for smaller details

The more limitations you work with, often leads to the more interesting soutions.
